***********************
Generating a dictionary
***********************

We have trained several G2P models that are available for download (:ref:`pretrained_g2p`).

.. warning::

   Please note that G2P models trained prior to 2.0 cannot be used with MFA 2.0.  If you would like to use
   these models, please use the the 1.0.1 or 1.1 g2p utilities or retrain a new G2P model following
   :ref:`g2p_model_training`.

To construct a pronunciation dictionary from your .lab or .TextGrid files, simply input:

.. code-block:: bash

    mfa g2p g2p_model_path input_path output_path

The argument ``g2p_model_path`` can either be a fully specified path to a G2P model you've trained previously
or one that you've downloaded via the :code:`mfa download g2p` command (see :ref:`pretrained_g2p`). The
``input_path`` argument can either be a text file of words to generate transcriptions for or a corpus directory that
will be inspected for text transcripts and a word list will be compiled and pronunciations generated.  The
``output_path`` argument is the full path to where the resulting pronunciation dictionary should be saved.

.. note::

   Generating pronunciations to supplement your existing pronunciation
   dictionary can be done by running the validation utility (see :ref:`running_the_validator`), and then use the path
   to the ``oovs_found.txt`` file that it generates.


Pronunciation dictionaries can also be generated from the orthographies of the words themselves, rather than relying on
a trained G2P model.  This functionality should be reserved for languages with transparent orthographies, close to 1-to-1
grapheme-to-phoneme mapping.

.. code-block:: bash

    mfa g2p input_path output_path

Extra options:

.. option:: -t DIRECTORY
               --temp_directory DIRECTORY

   Temporary directory root to use for generating dictionary, default is ``~/Documents/MFA``

.. option:: -j NUMBER
               --num_jobs NUMBER

  Number of jobs to use; defaults to 3, set higher if you have more
  processors available and would like to generate pronunciations faster

.. option:: -c
               --clean

  Forces removal of temporary files under ``~/Documents/MFA`` or the specified temporary directory
  prior to generating the dictionary.

.. option:: -n NUMBER
               --num_pronunciations NUMBER

  Number of pronunciation variants to generate per word, the default is 1

.. option:: --include_bracketed

  Flag for whether to generate pronunciations for words that are enclosed in brackets (i.e., [...], (...), <...>)

See :ref:`dict_generating_example` for an example of how to use G2P functionality with a premade example.
