Installation
************

All platforms
=============

.. warning::

   Windows native install is not fully supported in 2.0.  G2P functionality will be unavailable due to Pynini supporting
   only Linux and MacOS. To use G2P functionality on Windows, please set up the "Windows Subsystem
   For Linux" and use the Bash console to continue the instructions.

1. Install Anaconda/Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Create new environment via :code:`conda create -n aligner -c conda-forge montreal-forced-aligner sox python=3.8 openfst pynini ngram baumwelch`

   a. On Windows to use the aligner natively without G2P functionality, use the command :code:`conda create -n aligner -c conda-forge kaldi sox python=3.8`

3. Ensure you're in the new environment created (:code:`conda activate aligner`)
4. Install via pip :code:`pip install montreal-forced-aligner`

To upgrade to the latest version of MFA:

1. Activate your conda environment (i.e., :code:`conda activate aligner`)
2. Run :code:`pip install montreal-forced-aligner -U`

.. note::

   MFA 2.0.0a5 and earlier used Pynini version 2.1.0.  As of 2.0.0a6, versions have been upgraded to the latest version
   of Pynini, but there were some breaking changes, so please be sure to upgrade via :code:`conda upgrade -c conda-forge kaldi sox openfst pynini ngram baumwelch`
   if you installed a previous 2.0 alpha version to ensure correct performance.

.. note::

   Kaldi is now built on conda-forge, so installation of third party binaries is wholly through conda from 2.0.0b4 onwards
   I plan to put MFA on conda-forge eventually as well, so installation will be handled just through that.


Files created when using the Montreal Forced Aligner
====================================================

The aligner will save data and logs for the models it trains in a new folder,
``Documents/MFA`` (which it creates in your user's home directory).  If a model for a corpus already
exists in MFA, it will use any existing models if you try to align it again.
(If this is not desired, delete or move the old model folder or use the ``--clean`` flag.)
You can specify your own temporary directory by using the ``-t``
flag when calling the executable.

Supported functionality
=======================

Currently in the 2.0 alpha, supported functionality is somewhat fragmented across platforms.  Native support for features
is as follows.  Note that Windows can use Windows Subsystem for Linux to use the Linux version as necessary.
