.. Montreal Forced Aligner documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Installation
===================================================

Download the montreal-forced-aligner folder, and save it wherever you want to run the aligner from.  Nothing else is required to be able to run the aligner.

The aligner will save data and logs for the models it trains in a new folder, Documents/MFA (which it creates).  If a model for a corpus folder already exists in MFA, it will use the existing model if you try to align it again.  (If this is not desired, delete or move the old model folder.)
