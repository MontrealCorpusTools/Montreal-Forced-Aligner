MFA API
=======

.. warning::

   While the MFA API is fairly stable, I do tend to do refactors on fairly regular basis.  As 2.0 gets more stable, these are likely to get smaller and smaller, and I will try to keep the API docs as up-to-date as possible, so if something breaks in any scripts depending on MFA, please check back here.
