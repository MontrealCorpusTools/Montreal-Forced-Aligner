Dictionaries should be specified in the following format:

::

  WORDA PHONEA PHONEB
  WORDB PHONEB PHONEC

where each line is a word with a transcription separated by white space.
Each phone in the transcription should be separated by white space as well.

A dictionary for English that has good coverage is the lexicon derived
from the LibriSpeech corpus (`LibriSpeech lexicon`_).
This lexicon uses the Arpabet transcription format (like the `CMU Pronouncing Dictionary`_).

There is an option when running the aligner for not using a dictionary (``--no_dict``).
When run in this mode, the aligner will construct pronunciations for words
in the corpus based on their orthographies.  In this mode, a dataset with an example transcription

::

  WORDA WORDB

for a sound file would have the following dictionary generated:

::

  WORDA W O R D A
  WORDB W O R D B

The Prosodylab-aligner has two preconstructed dictionaries as well, one
for English (`Prosodylab-aligner English dictionary`_)
and one for Quebec French (`Prosodylab-aligner French dictionary`_), also see `dictionaries`_ for a list of supported dictionaries.

.. note::

   See the page on :doc:`generating dictionaries <dictionary_generating>` for how to use G2P models to generate a dictionary
   from our pretrained models.

Non-speech annotations
----------------------

There are two special phones that can be used for annotations that are not speech, ``sil`` and ``spn``.  The ``sil`` phone is used
to model silence, and the ``spn`` phone is used to model unknown words.  If you have annotations for non-speech vocalizations that are
similar to silence like breathing or exhalation, you can use the ``sil`` phone to align those.  You can use the ``spn`` phone
to align annotations like laughter, coughing, etc.

  {LG} spn
  {SL} sil
