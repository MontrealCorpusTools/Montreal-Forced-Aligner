****************
Training a Model
****************

Another tool included with MFA allows you to train a G2P (Grapheme to Phoneme) model automatically from a given pronunciation dictionary.
This type of model can be used for :doc:`generating dictionaries <dictionary_generating>`.
It requires a pronunciation dictionary with each line consisting of the orthographic transcription followed by the
phonetic transcription. The model is generated using the `Phonetisaurus`_ software, which generates FST (finite state transducer)
files. The G2P model output will be a .zip file like the acoustic model generated from alignment.

Required options
----------------
.. cmdoption:: dictionary_path

   The user inputs the path to a pronunciation dictionary

.. cmdoption:: path

   The user specifies the desired destination for the model

To train a model from a pronunciation dictionary, the following command is used: 

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/train_g2p /path/to/dictionary/file /path/to/output/dictionary

One optional argument, ``--korean`` is also available. This should be used if working with a Hangul dictionary, as it
decomposes the dictionary and increases the accuracy greatly.  All options can be viewed by inputting ``bin/train_g2p --help``.


Example
=======

In ```Montreal-Forced-Aligner/examples/``` you will find a small Chinese dictionary. It is too small to generate a usable model, but can provide a helpful example. Inputting 

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/train_g2p --path_to_dict=Montreal-Forced-Aligner/examples/chinese_dict.txt --path=Montreal-Forced-Aligner/examples/CH_test_model

This should take no more than a few seconds, and should produce a model which could be used for :doc:`generating dictionaries <dictionary_generating>` 

**NB** because there is so little data in chinese_dict.txt, the model produced will not be very accurate. Thus any dictionary generated from it will also be inaccurate.
