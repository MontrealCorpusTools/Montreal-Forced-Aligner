Transcribe audio files ``(mfa transcribe)``
===========================================

.. warning::

   The technology that MFA uses is several years out of date, and as such if you have other options available such as :xref:`coqui` or other production systems for :abbr:`STT (Speech to Text)`, we recommend using those.  The transcription capabilities are more here for completeness.
