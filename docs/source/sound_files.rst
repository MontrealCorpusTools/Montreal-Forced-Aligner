Sound files
***********

The currently only support format for sound files is ``.wav``.  Sound files
must adhear to the following conditions:

.. note ::
   Sound files will be ignored if there is no ``.lab`` or ``.TextGrid`` with the same name as the sound file. The aligner
   will print a warning message when this happens and log all such files.

Sampling rate
=============

Sound files can be aligned regardless of their sampling rate so long as
it is more than 16 kHz. Sound files to be aligned do not have to be all
a single sampling rate, but each speaker must have a consistent sampling
rate across their files.

.. note ::
   Sound files with sampling rate lower 16 kHz will currently be ignored by the aligner. The features that the aligner
   extracts are MFCCs dervied from spectra from 0 to 7.8 kHz, so sound files must have Nyquist frequencies higher than 7.8 kHz.
   There is no difference between the features derived from a sound file sampled at 16 kHz and one sampled at 44.1 kHz.
   Any ignored files will cause a warning to be printed to the console, and the list of such files will be available in
   the aligner's log.

Duration
========

In general, audio segments (sound files for Prosodylab-aligner format or intervals
for the TextGrid format) should be less than ~ 30 seconds for best performance
(the shorter the faster).  We recommend using breaks like breaths
or silent pauses (i.e., not associated with a stop closure) to separate the audio segments.
