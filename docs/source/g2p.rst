Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P)
*************************

There are many cases where a language's orthography is transparent, and creating an exhaustive list of all words in a corpus
is doable by rule rather than just listing.  For these cases, we offer pretrained grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) models, as
well as a way to train new G2P models.
