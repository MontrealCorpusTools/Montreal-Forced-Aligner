Changelog
=========

2.0.0a12
--------

- Updated how sample rates are handled. MFA now generates features between 80 Hz and 7800 Hz and allows downsampling and
  upsampling, so there will be no more errors or warnings about unsupported sample rates or speakers with different sample
  rates
- Fixed a bug where some options for generating MFCCs weren't properly getting picked up (e.g., snip-edges)
- (EXPERIMENTAL) Added better support for varying frame shift. In :code:`mfa align`, you can now add a flag of :code:`--frame_shift 1` to align
  with millisecond shifts between frames.  Please note this is more on the experimental side, as it increases computational
  time significantly and I don't know fully the correct options to use for :code:`self_loop_scale`, :code:`transition_scale`,
  and :code:`acoustic_scale` to generate good alignments.
- Fixed a bug in G2P training with relative paths for output model
- Cleaned up validator output

2.0.0a11
--------

- Fixed a bug in analyzing unaligned utterances introduced by changes in segment representation

2.0.0a9
-------

- Fixed a bug when loading :code:`utterance_lengths.scp` from previous failed runs
- Added the ability to generate multiple pronunciations per word when running G2P, see the extra options in
  :ref:`g2p_dictionary_generating` for more details.

2.0.0a8
-------

- Fixed a bug in generating alignments for TextGrid corpora

2.0.0a7
-------

- Upgraded dependency of Pynini version to 2.1.4, please update package versions via :code:`conda upgrade -c conda-forge openfst pynini ngram baumwelch`
  if you had previously installed MFA.
- Allowed for splitting clitics on multiple apostrophes
- Fixed bug in checking for brackets in G2P (`PR #194`_)
- Updated Annotator utility (:ref:`annotator` for more details) to be generally more usable for TextGrid use cases and
  adjusting segments and their transcriptions
- Improved handling of stereo files with TextGrids so that MFA doesn't need to generate temporary files for each channel

2.0.0a5
-------

- Fixed a bug in feature where sorting was not correct due to lack of speakers at the beginnings
  of utterances
- Fixed a bug where alignment was not performing speaker adaptation correctly
- Added a flag to :code:`align` command to disable speaker adaptation if desired
- Fixed a bug where the aligner was not properly ignored short utterances (< 0.13 seconds)
- Changed the internal handling of stereo files to use :code:`_channelX` rather than :code:`_A` and :code:`_B`
- Add a :code:`version` subcommand to output the version

2.0.0a4
-------

- Fixed a corpus parsing bug introduced by new optimized parsing system in 2.0.0a3

2.0.0a3
-------

- Further optimized corpus parsing algorithm to use multiprocessing and to load from saved files in temporary directories
- Revamped and fixed training using subsets of the corpora
- Fixed issue with training LDA systems
- Fixed a long-standing issue with words being marked as OOV due to improperly parsing clitics
- Updated logging to better capture when errors occur due to Kaldi binaries to better locate sources of issues

2.0.0
-----

Currently under development with major changes, see :ref:`whats_new_2_0`.

- Fixed a bug in dictionary parsing that caused initial numbers in pronunciations to be misparsed and ignored
- Updated sound file parsing to use PySoundFile rather than inbuilt wave module, which should lead to more informative error
  messages for files that do not meet Kaldi's input requirements
- Removed multiprocessing from speaker adaptation, as the executables use multiple threads leading to a bottleneck in
  performance.  This change should result in faster speaker adaptation.
- Optimized corpus parsing algorithm to be O(n log n) instead of O(n^2) (`PR #194`_)


1.1.0
-----

Major changes to system, see :ref:`whats_new_1_1`.

1.0.0
-----

- Added Grapheme-to-Phoneme capabilities
- Acoustic models no longer contain the dictionary they were trained with
- Dictionaries must be specified when aligning using pretrained models
- The aligner now automatically cleans the temporary directory when the previous run failed
- Added validation for types of command line arguments
- Catch and list files that could not be read using UTF-8
- Update Kaldi version to 5.1 and OpenFST version to 1.6.2 on Mac and Linux
- Add support for specifying custom non-speech annotations in pronunciation dictionary with sil and spn
- Made command line flags more consistent in spelling
- Made pretrained models for many languages available

0.8.0
-----

- Fixed an issue where aligning using pretrained models was improperly updating the original model with sparser data
- Added a flag to turn off speaker adaptation when aligning using a pretrained model
- Optimized training graph generation when aligning using a pretrained model

0.7.3
-----

- Added warning messages and log output when wav files are ignored because they have too low of a sampling rate or
  no .lab or .TextGrid file associated with them

0.7.2
-----

- Fixed an issue where speaker character flags were being ignored when parsing TextGrid files

0.7.1
-----

- Fixed an issue where the number of gaussians was set too low for triphone training

0.7.0
-----

- Fixed an issue with unicode characters not being correctly parsed when using ``--nodict``
- Fixed an issue where short intervals in TextGrid were not being properly ignored
- Added a command line option ``--temp_directory`` to allow for user specification of the
  temporary directory that MFA stores all files during alignment, with the
  default of ``~/Documents/MFA``
- Added logging directory and some logging for when utterances are ignored

0.6.3
-----

- Improved memory and time efficiency of extracting channels from stereo
  files, particularly for long sound files

0.6.2
-----

- Fixed an issue where pretrained models were not being bundled with the source code

0.6.1
-----

- Fixed an issue with Linux binaries not finding Kaldi binaries
- English models now use all of LibriSpeech dataset and not just clean
  subset (increased number of accents being the primary difference between the two)

0.6.0
-----

- Added commandline argument ``--clean`` to remove temporary files
- Added support for multiple sampling rates in a single dataset
- Fix some bugs relating to using a single process
- Fixed a bug where spaces were being inserted into transcriptions when using ``--nodict``
- Fixed a bug where having no out-of-vocabulary items would cause a crash at the end of aligning
- Fixed a bug where the frozen executable could not find the included pretrained models
- Fixed an issue where dictionaries in model outputs were binary files rather than editable text files
- Added docstrings to main classes
- Updated built in model ``english`` for the full 1000-hour LibriSpeech corpus

0.5.0
-----

- Initial release
- Prosodylab-aligner format supported
- TextGrid format supported
