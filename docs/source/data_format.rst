Prosodylab-aligner format
=========================

Every .wav sound file you are aligning must have a corresponding .lab
file containing the text transcription of that .wav file.  The .wav and
.lab files must have the same name. For example, if you have ``givrep_1027_2_1.wav``,
its transcription should be in ``givrep_1027_2_1.lab`` (which is just a
text file with the .lab extension).

.. note:: If you have transcriptions in a
   tab-separated text file (or an Excel file, which can be saved as one),
   you can generate .lab files from it using the relabel function of relabel_clean.py.
   The relabel_clean.py script is currently in the prosodylab.alignertools repository on GitHub.

In terms of directory structure, the default configuration assumes that
files are separated into subdirectories based on their speaker (with one
speaker per file).

An alternative way to specify which speaker says which
segment is to use the ``-s`` flag with some number of characters of the file name as the speaker identifier.

The output from aligning this format of data will be TextGrids that have a tier
for words and a tier for phones.

.. _textgrid_format:

TextGrid format
===============

The other main format that is supported is long sound files accompanied
by TextGrids that specify orthographic transcriptions for short intervals
of speech.

If the ``-s`` flag is specified, the tier names will not be used as speaker names, and instead the first X characters
specified by the flag will be used as the speaker name.

By default, each tier corresponds to a speaker (speaker "237" in the above example), so it is possible to
align speech for multiple speakers per sound file using this format.

Stereo files are supported as well, where it assumes that if there are
multiple talkers, the first half of speaker tiers are associated with the first
channel, and the second half of speaker tiers are associated with the second channel.

The output from aligning will be a TextGrid with word and phone tiers for
each speaker.

.. note ::
   Intervals in the TextGrid less than 100 milliseconds will not be aligned.

Transcription normalization and dictionary lookup
=================================================

If a word is not found in the dictionary, and has no orthographic
markers for morpheme boundaries (apostrophes or hyphens), then it will
be replaced in the output with '<unk>' for unknown word.

.. note::

   The list of all unknown words (out of vocabulary words; OOV words) will
   be output to a file named ``oovs_found.txt``
   in the output directory, if you would like to add them to the dictionary
   you are using.  To help find any typos in transcriptions, a file named
   ``utterance_oovs.txt`` will be put in the output directory and will list
   the unknown words per utterance.

As part of parsing orthographic transcriptions, punctuation is stripped
from the ends of words.  In addition, all words are converted to lowercase
so that dictionary lookup is not case-sensitive.

Dictionary lookup will attempt to generate the most maximal coverage of
novel forms if they use some overt morpheme boundary in the orthography.

For instance, in French, clitics are marked using apostrophes between the
bound clitic and the stem.  Thus given a dictionary like:

.. highlight:: none

::

   c'est S E
   c S E
   c' S
   etait E T E
   un A N

And two example orthographic transcriptions:

::

   c'est un c
   c'etait un c

The normalization would result in the following:

::

   c'est un c
   c' Ã©tait un c

With a pronunciation of:

::

   S E A N S E
   S E T E A N S E

The key point to note is that the pronunciation of the clitic ``c'`` is ``S``
and the pronunciation of the letter ``c`` in French is ``S A``.

The algorithm will try to associate the apostrophe with either the element
before (as for French clitics) or the element after (as for English clitics
like the possessive marker).

Hyphens are treated the same as apostrophes. For example, ``merry-go-round`` will
become ``merry go round`` if the hyphenated form is not in the dictionary.
If no words are found on splitting the word based on hyphens or apostrophes,
then the word will be treated as a single unit (single unknown word).
